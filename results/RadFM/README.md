# Run MultiMedEval on RadFM

The RadFM folder acts as a standalone evaluation script for RadFM. It contains the RadFM model and the script necessary to run MultiMedEval.

The user should define the MultiMedEval config file as explained in the main README of the MultiMedEval repo.
The user should define the path to the RadFM checkpoint and a path to store the "cleaned" version of this model.

The user should install all the dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

Running the benchmark.py file will do the setup and evaluation on the model.
